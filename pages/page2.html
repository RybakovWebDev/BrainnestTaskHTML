    <h2>PS VR2 is a direct successor to PS VR, which was released in 2016.</h2>
    <p>
      Development of PS VR2 took about six years, and was developed simultaneously alongside the PlayStation 5, with the
      goal to craft the perfect match of a console and a virtual reality device.
    </p>
    <p>PS VR2 was announced on 2022 at the Consumer Electronics Show.</p>
    <p>Next, we will talk about the headset's hardware.</p>
