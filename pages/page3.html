    <h2>Here are some specs:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Display method:</b> OLED</li>
      <li><b>Panel resolution:</b> OLED</li>
      <li><b>Panel refresh rate:</b> OLED</li>
      <li>
        <b>Sensors:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Motion sensor: Six-axis motion sensing system (three-axis gyroscope, three-axis accelerometer)</li>
          <li>Attachment sensor: IR proximity sensor</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cameras:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>4 embedded cameras for headset and controller tracking</li>
          <li>IR camera for eye tracking per eye</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unlike the first generation PlayStation VR, which tracked player movements through an external PlayStation Camera,
      <br />
      the PS VR2 will track movements by four cameras mounted on the headset. The headset tracking cameras will also be
      used
      <br />
      to track the controllers, and to give video feed for the "see-through view" feature, which will allow the user to
      view
      <br />
      their surroundings without needing to take off the headset.

    <h2>One of the main improvements however are the new controllers.</h2>
    <p>They are called <i>Sense</i> controllers.</p>
    <p>
      They were designed with a focus on balancing the center of gravity and reducing weight, while also maintaining
      comfort <br />
      and incorporating new features, like haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers technology.
